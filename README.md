# Composition API projects (similar concept to react hook)
- dojo-blog (simple basic composition API)
- dojo-blog2 (with async code and composables)
    - using local json data
    - using json server to show json data
    - able to create new post
    - redirect to homepage after creating new post
    - newly created post will be saved in db base and will be automatically synced between local data and db base
    - created loading spinner
    - filter posts by click hashtag

* composition API doesnt have access to $router eg: this.$router.push({name: 'Home'}) or this.$router.go(-1) or this.$router.go(1) (in methods: {}). Hence, **useRouter** function inside the setup hook.
